					</section>

					<section>
						<p><strong>Froger 1968: </strong>La collation des manuscrits est une opération qui relève en quelque sorte de la comptabilité: la machine peut fort bien l'exécuter.</p>

						<p><strong>Marichal 1968: </strong>Pour les collations l'emploi d'un ordinateur est dans la plupart de cas irréalisable.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Collaboration</h2>
						<p><strong>Dearing 1970: </strong>a student introduced me to a professional programmer in the aircraft industry. [...] He did the programming in his spare time over a couple of months and charged it to experience. [...] Mr. Bandat [the second programmer] also worked in his spare time. [...] We paid him a lump sum on delivery, but it did not fully compensate him for his time.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Collaboration</h2>
						<p><strong>Petty and Gibson 1970: </strong>Since one of the most tirying difficulties of our first attempt had been the uncertainty of our communications with the programmers, Mr. Petty proposed that a second effort be made in which he would be the programmer. We would thus be certain that decisions made by us as textual scholars would not be circumvented when they were translated into machine code.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Rigorous re-thinking</h2>
						<p><strong>Michel 1982: </strong>Les progrès réalisés sont largement déterminés par la rigueur méthodologique des concepts que l'informatique impose à celui qui en use.</p>

						<p><strong>Robinson 1989: </strong>Along the way, I learnt several computer languages and found myself re-thinking some of the fundamental notions of textual criticism.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Modularity</h2>
						<p><strong>Gilbert 1979: </strong>The COLLATE system is modular, i.e., it is composed of a series of programs each of which performs a simple procedure. Such an approach allows the editor to correct errors in the data as they are perceived. It also means that less time is spent waiting for computer resources to become available.</p>

						<p><strong>Waite 1979: </strong>... separating as much as possible the different steps in the program so that they can be altered independently to meet varying conditions.
</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>How to</h2>
						<p><strong>Raben 1979: </strong>If we consider this problem [that of the alignment] in terms of points on a series of arrays rather than on several linear formats.</p>

						<p><strong>Dearing 1970: </strong>It is not as difficult to compare texts by computer as it is to record the results of the comparison in a way that will be easy and unambiguous to read. My desires as to the print-out determined how Mr. Bland [the programmer] chose to do the comparison.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Future in the past</h4>
						<p><strong>Ott 1973: </strong>By means of this new tool [Tustep], which we have in electronic data processing, new and higher standards are imposed not only on the results of others sciences, but also on critical editions - standards which can scarcely be satisfied by traditional methods. This is , in my view, the main reason why electronic data processing should be employed in the preparation of critical editions, especially in large and complex projects. The question whether it is possible or not to save time and / or money by these methods is only of secondary importance. The expenses necessary for future critical editions may possibly be even higher than they have been in the past when these tools were not yet available.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Future in the past</h2>
						<p><strong>Raben 1979: </strong>We who believe in bringing to the study of literature every tool that can increase our aesthetic responses and intellectual comprehension are accused of restricting our field of vision, of reducing the greatness of art to the trivial level of counting or alphabetizing. It may be many years before the true range and basis of our efforts will be generally recognized.</p>
